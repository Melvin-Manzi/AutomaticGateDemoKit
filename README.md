# AutomaticGateDemoKit
AutomaticGateDemoKit is an Arduino-powered system that opens a gate by scanning a recognized car plate and closes it after the car passes. It boosts security, cuts labor costs, and removes the need for a guard at entry pointsâ€”ideal for homes and institutions needing efficient access control.
