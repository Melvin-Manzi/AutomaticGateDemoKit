🚗 **AutomaticGateDemoKit**


AutomaticGateDemoKit is an Arduino-based smart gate automation system that enhances security and convenience by automating gate access. It scans a car's license plate, opens the gate if the vehicle is authorized, and closes it once the car has passed—eliminating the need for constant manual operation.

**🛠 Features**

1. Automatic gate opening via license plate recognition

2. Closes the gate after the vehicle passes through

3. Improves security and access control

4. Reduces labor costs and human error

5. Ideal for homes, offices, and institutions

**⚙️ Hardware Requirements**

1. Arduino Uno or Mega

2. Servo motor or motor driver with gate mechanism

3. IR sensors / Ultrasonic sensors (for car detection)

4. License plate scanner (e.g., camera module or simulated via serial input)

5. Jumper wires, breadboard

6. Power supply

**🧾 File**


**automatic_gate.ino:** Main Arduino sketch containing the logic for gate control, car detection, and timing.

**🧰 Setup Instructions**

** Connect Hardware:**

1. Attach IR/Ultrasonic sensors to detect vehicle presence.

2. Connect the gate motor to a digital pin through a motor driver or servo pin.

3. Set up the license plate scanner or simulation input.

**Upload Code:**


1. Open automatic_gate.ino in the Arduino IDE.

2. Select your board and port.

3. Upload the code.

**Test System:**


1. Simulate or input an authorized plate.

2. Observe the gate opening and closing sequence.

3. Tune delays and sensor positions as needed.

**🧠 How It Works**

1. The system waits for a car to approach.

2. The license plate is scanned.

3. If the plate is recognized, the gate opens.

4. After the car passes, the sensor detects the exit and the gate closes.

**📌 Notes**

For actual plate recognition, you may integrate with a camera and external processor like a Raspberry Pi.

The current version may use placeholder values for testing logic.
